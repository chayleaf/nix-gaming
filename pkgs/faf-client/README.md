# FAF Client

To run FAF, first run Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance via Steam
normally at least once. After you make sure it works, run
`faf-client-setup` to set up the path to game data, settings and Proton
wrapper correctly. Alternatively, if you don't want to use Steam you can
provide your own launch command to `faf-client-setup`.
